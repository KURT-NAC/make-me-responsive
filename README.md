- Fork the code using your Codepen account (create a free one if you don't already have one)
- Make the page responsive (it should look good from the smallest mobile device to a large desktop)
- Make the first h1 tag to be fixed at the top of the window so it always shows when you scroll down
- Make the "Back to top" link scroll to the top of the "Most Important Story" module and not to the top of the page.
- Add a function so when a user clicks on the hyperlink in the "Most Important Story" module it goes to https://picsum.photos/images instead of the existing href value.
- Add a function so when any "Less Important Story" module is clicked it gets replaced with a new "Less Important Story". Only 3 "Less Important Story" modules should appear to the user at once. Never show the same "Less Important Story" at the same time.
- You're welcome to change any markup, CSS and add JS as needed. Please use vanilla JS (no frameworks or libraries).

Please provide the forked codepen URL when completed, be sure the latest is saved!
